Python Advent Calendar
======================

This repository is the a series of 24 small files with examples for common
tasks, quizzes and practical exercises, aiming to increase your Python
literacy. It assumes a very basic understanding of python or programming in
general. They instructions partially build upon each other, so it is
recommended to do them in the intended order.

The calendar is organised as a git repository, so make sure you have git
and python 2.7 installed. To open all the "windows" up to and including the one
for the current day, just execute the `checkout.py` script
